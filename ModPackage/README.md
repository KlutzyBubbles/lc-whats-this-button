# Whats this button

Ever tried rebinding keys in mods and wondered 'what in the world do i type to bind this button'. Well thats what this mod is for.

Simply load it, change the keybinding in game then it will display the keybind text on the screen.

Or better yet, see the below info on various keybinds. If you dont see your keybind listed, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/KlutzyBubbles/lc-whats-this-button/issues/new) so that i can add it.
